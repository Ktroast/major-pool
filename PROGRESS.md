## Auth migration — phase 1a (anonymous auth foundation)

Merged on branch `phase-1a-anon-auth`. Applies the invisible half of phase 1 — session bootstrap and membership writes with no UI changes. Smoke tests passed May 11, 2026.

| Item | Commit |
|------|--------|
| Add `user_pools` table + RLS policy to `supabase/schema.sql` | c53d73f |
| Bootstrap anonymous Supabase session in `boot()` | 6d4d8ff |
| Add `recordPoolVisit()`; wire into `loadPool` and `createPool` | b3da8e3 |
| Update CLAUDE.md + PLAN_AUTH.md for phase 1a completion | 77655a3 |

Manual steps required before smoke testing:
- Apply `user_pools` CREATE TABLE and RLS policy SQL via Supabase dashboard (see `supabase/schema.sql`).

Acceptance criteria — all passed:
- [x] Visiting `/` or `/pin/ABC123` — no visible change.
- [x] `await sb.auth.getSession()` in devtools returns an anonymous session.
- [x] Loading a pool creates/updates a `user_pools` row; reload bumps `last_visited`, `joined_at` unchanged.
- [x] Creating a pool creates a `user_pools` row with `role='commissioner'`.
- [x] Different browser/device → different `user_id` row.
- [x] Supabase anonymous-auth toggle confirmed ON (already done per spike notes).

## Auth migration — phase 1b (hub UI + localStorage migration)

Merged on branch `phase-1b-hub`. Adds the visible half of phase 1 — the multi-pool hub at `/`, legacy state migration, and routing changes. Acceptance testing passed May 12, 2026.

| Item | Commit |
|------|--------|
| Add view-hub panel skeleton + CSS | 16501f4 |
| Wire hub query + render hub rows | 4bd0005 |
| Route / to hub when user has pools | 0534305 |
| Migrate legacy localStorage state to user_pools | 8b3be1e |
| Docs: phase 1b complete | 20636f5 |
| **Bugfix:** `recordPoolVisit` role-preserving; `isCommissioner` trusts `user_pools` row | 331d192 |
| **Bugfix docs:** role-stickiness invariant in CLAUDE.md | f76867e |

Bug reproduced and fixed before merge: the phase 1b migration clears `major_pool_commish_keys_v1` after success. This caused `recordPoolVisit(p, 'player')` to overwrite commissioner rows on every subsequent pool visit once localStorage was cleared. Fix: (a) omit `role` from the upsert payload on player calls so on-conflict updates only bump `last_visited`; (b) read the `user_pools` row in `loadPool` before computing `isCommissioner` so the DB value is a durable fallback once localStorage keys are gone. One demoted row in the preview environment was manually repaired via the Supabase dashboard — no production impact since phase 1b hadn't merged yet.

Acceptance criteria — all passed:
- [x] Fresh install → landing; create pool → `/pin/{pin}`; back to `/` → hub with commissioner badge
- [x] Hub row click navigates to `/pin/{pin}` and `last_visited` updates
- [x] Multiple pools appear sorted most-recent first
- [x] Legacy migration: `major_pool_commish_keys_v1` set → hub shows commissioner row, key cleared
- [x] Legacy migration: only `lastPin` set → hub shows player row, `lastPin` preserved
- [x] Empty hub (0 rows) → landing controls shown, not empty hub
- [x] `/pin/{pin}` direct link still works for users with no hub history
- [x] iOS PWA: `/` with `lastPin` set but 0 `user_pools` rows → loads last pool (legacy fallback)
- [x] RLS: `sb.from('user_pools').select('*').neq('user_id', getCurrentUserId())` returns 0 rows

## Open / upcoming

- **Auth phases 2–5** — entry linking, magic-link claiming, commissioner migration, leagues (see PLAN_AUTH.md)
- **Season-long scoring** — multi-week / multi-major cumulative leaderboard. Entries persist across events; scores accumulate over the season. Schema and UI TBD.
- **Golfball mascot** — a golfball character who drinks and smokes. Vibes TBD.
